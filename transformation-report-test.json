The csproj file has been updated to target the newer framework while maintaining the Microsoft.NET.Sdk project type.\n\n## Key Changes:\n\n* **Framework Upgrade**: Changed target framework from `netstandard2.0` to `net8.0`\n* **XML Declaration**: Added XML version and encoding declaration\n* **File Format**: Removed blank lines, making the file more compact\n\nThis update enables the project to leverage .NET 8.0 features instead of the more limited .NET Standard 2.0 compatibility surface. The change may affect library compatibility with older framework versions as the project is no longer targeting the cross-platform compatibility layer.",
